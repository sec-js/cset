                <p>Ransomware is an ever-evolving form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any
                    files and
                    the
                    systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption.
                    Ransomware
                    actors often target and threaten to sell or leak exfiltrated data or authentication information if
                    the
                    ransom is
                    not paid. In recent years, ransomware incidents have become increasingly prevalent among the
                    Nation’s state,
                    local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government entities and critical infrastructure organizations.
                </p>

                <p>Malicious actors continue to adjust and evolve their ransomware tactics over time, and CISA analysts
                    remain
                    vigilant in maintaining awareness of ransomware attacks and associated tactics, techniques, and
                    procedures
                    across the country and around the world.</p>

                <p>This Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) will help you understand your cybersecurity posture with
                    respect
                    to
                    the ever-evolving threat of ransomware. The RRA also provides a clear path for improvement, and
                    contains an
                    evolving progression of questions tiered by the categories of basic, intermediate, and advanced.
                    This is
                    intended
                    to help an organization improve by focusing on the basics first, and then progressing by
                    implementing
                    practices
                    through the intermediate and advanced categories.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

                <p><b><span>Ransomware Readiness Assessment Composition: Goals and Practices

                        </span></b></p>

                <p>This assessment represents one Domain that addresses Ransomware and is constructed with ten Goals and
                    Practice
                    Questions that address each Goal.</p>

                <p>The Practices are tiered as Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each question contains an identifier
                    structured as follows: </p>

                <p><b>Goal</b> [GG] : <b>Level</b> [B,I,A] . <b>Question Number</b> [Q##] </p>

                <p>An example of the above structure is <b>AM:I.Q03</b>, which represents <b>Asset Management, Level
                        “Intermediate,”
                        Question Number 3.

                    </b></p>

                <p>The blue oval beneath each identifier indicates the Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced tier for the
                    question.
                </p>

                <p><span><img src="assets/images/RRA/tutorial/image001.png" alt="tier indicator example" /></span></p>

                <p>The RRA practices and tiers (basic, intermediate, and advanced) are designed to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        assist an organization to
                        understand its current state of readiness to address the threat of ransomware
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to assist the organization with
                        implementing a focused path for improvement.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p><b>Implementation approach:</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Organizations that are
                        unfamiliar with ransomware and need to begin basic cyber hygiene safeguards against ransomware
                        threats
                        should focus on implementing the basic tier of practices.</li>

                    <li>After completing the basic tier of
                        the improvement effort, organizations looking to further improve their risk posture against
                        ransomware
                        should
                        implement the intermediate tier of practices.</li>

                    <li>Organizations that have already
                        adopted basic and intermediate level RRA practices and are looking to improve their response to
                        ransomware
                        threats should focus on adopting the practices in the Advanced Tier.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>This suggested path to improvement can always be adapted by the organization to suit its own
                    needs.<span>&nbsp;
                    </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>Each practice question contains a yes/no response scale to evaluate whether the organization has
                    implemented
                    each
                    practice:</p>

                <p><span><img src="assets/images/RRA/tutorial/image004.png" alt="yes no answer controls" /></span></p>
