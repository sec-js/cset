    <h2>Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) Analysis Configuration</h2>
    <h4>Naming the Analysis</h4>

    <p>
        To realize the full benefits of this CIE Analysis tool, returning users can import previous answers as well as compare a previously completed Analysis as a baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
        All CIE users must first name and save their Analysis accordingly. Naming the CIE implementation takes place in the CIE Analysis Configuration screen. Naming conventions should be considered when saving for ease of locating a particular Analysis in the future.

    <h2>New CIE User</h2>
    <p>
        If you are a new user, the Import and Select Baseline fields below will be blank. Click “next” to begin your CIE Analysis.

    <h2>Returning CIE User</h2>
    <p>
        A returning user will have a selection of previous CIE Analyses to return to on their dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing an initial CIE Analysis, the user will have the option to later recall the Analysis to:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Increase efficiency</strong> when prepopulating a future Analysis by importing answers from a previous CIE Analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Track progress</strong> by choosing a previously completed CIE Analysis to serve as a baseline for comparison against the new Analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a returning user, the fields below offer the ability to <strong>Import</strong> a previous Analysis and/or Select a Baseline Analysis from a previously saved CIE Analysis.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Import CIE Answers</h2>
    <p>Import all answers from a previous CIE Analysis. All answers, comments, and artifacts currently in the Analysis will be overwritten.</p>
