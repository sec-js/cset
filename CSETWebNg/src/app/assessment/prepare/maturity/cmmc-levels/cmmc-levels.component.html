          <h5>Processes: Performed</h5>
          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 1 requires that an organization performs the specified practices. Because the organization may be able
            to perform these practices only in an ad-hoc manner and may or may not rely on documentation, process
            maturity
            is not assessed for Level 1.

            Level 1 focuses on the protection of FCI and consists only of practices that correspond to the basic

          <h5>Processes: Documented</h5>
          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 2 requires that an organization establish and document practices and policies to guide the
            implementation of their CMMC efforts. The documentation of practices enables individuals to perform them in
            a
            repeatable manner. Organizations develop mature capabilities by documenting their processes and practicing
            them as documented.

          <h5>Practices: Intermediate Cyber Hygiene</h5>
          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 2 serves as a progression from Level 1 to Level 3 and consists of a subset of the security
            requirements
            specified in NIST SP 800-171 as well as practices from other standards and references. Because this level is
            a
            transitional stage, a subset of the practices reference the protection of CUI.

          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 3 requires that an organization establish, maintain and resource a plan demonstrating the management
            of
            activities for practice implementation. The plan may include information on missions, goals, project plans,
            resourcing, required training, and involvement of relevant stakeholders.

          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 3 focuses on the protection of CUI and encompasses all of the security requirements specified in NIST
            SP
            800-171 as well as additional practices to mitigate threats. Note that DFARS clause 252.204-7012 applies,
            and
            specifies additional requirements beyond NIST SP 800-171 security requirements such as incident reporting.

          <div class="mb-3">
            Level 4 requires that an organization review and measure practices for effectiveness. In addition,
            organizations at this level are able to take corrective action when necessary and inform higher level
            management of status or issues on a recurring basis.

            Level 4 focuses on the protection of CUI from APTs and encompasses a subset of the enhanced security
            requirements from Draft NIST SP 800-171B as well as other cybersecurity best practices. These practices
            enhance the detection and response capabilities of an organization to address and adapt to the changing
            tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by APTs.
