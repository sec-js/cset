<div class="p h2"><h2>How Do I Recover Data?</h2></div>
<div class="p">CSET continuously saves entered data. If CSET is closed or the browser restarts, all entered data is stored automatically.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>How do I import a file from a previous release of CSET?</h2></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_56F4564E24">See </span><a class="local_link" href="cset_main_navigation.htm#id_5"><span class="de_AC776ED092">Importing an Existing&#160; Assessment</span></a><span class="de_56F4564E24"> for more information.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Which standard or model should I use?</h2></div>
<div class="p"><span class="de_56F4564E24">Only the user and the assessment team can answer that question for their organization. View the </span><a class="local_link" href="new_assessment.htm#id_3"><span class="de_AC776ED092">assessment descriptions</span></a><span class="de_56F4564E24"> for each standard and model in the </span><a class="local_link" href="new_assessment.htm#id_2"><span class="de_AC776ED092">Assessment Gallery</span></a><span class="de_56F4564E24"> for additional information.</span></div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Can I unclick an answer on the assessment screen after making a selection?</h2></div>
<div class="p">Yes, select the answer button again to clear the selection.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Iâ€™ve lost my zone on the diagram. Where did it go?</h2></div>
<div class="p">Like other objects, it may have been placed behind another zone or another shape. You can move or minimize the shapes to see if it is hidden behind them. To quickly see what is behind a zone or shape, select the <a class="local_link" href="diagramming_tool___arrange_menu.htm#id_1"><span class="de_2B94C39861">To Back</span></a> option in the <a class="local_link" href="diagramming_tool___arrange_menu.htm"><span class="de_2B94C39861">Arrange</span></a> menu. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">You might also check to see if it has been assigned to a layer that is not displayed. Select the <a class="local_link" href="diagramming_tool___view_menu.htm#id_3"><span class="de_2B94C39861">Layers</span></a> option in the <a class="local_link" href="diagramming_tool___view_menu.htm"><span class="de_2B94C39861">View</span></a> menu to ensure all layers are checked. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>I put in a text box on the diagram and want to change the style. How do I do it?</h2></div>
<div class="p">With the text object selected, used the <a class="local_link" href="diagramming_tool.htm#id_5"><span class="de_2B94C39861">Format panel</span></a> to change the text's font, size, style, color, and position.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>How do I connecting components on the diagram?</h2></div>
<div class="p">See <a class="local_link" href="adding_connectors.htm"><span class="de_2B94C39861">Adding Connectors</span></a> for more information.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>Can I change properties on multiple objects at once?</h2></div>
<div class="p">Yes, you can select multiple objects; however, the only property that can be changed for all of them is the Layer. You can also use the multi-select to remove the Unique flag and remove the question overrides, if there are any. To select multiple objects, you can drag a box around them with your cursor. Unfortunately, this can often capture nearby, but unwanted, objects. Another method is to hold down the keyboard Control (Ctrl) key while clicking the desired objects with the mouse. </div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>I have a Microsoft Visio diagram. Can I use it?</h2></div>
<div class="p">No, not with the current version of CSET.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p h2"><h2>In the Components Summary Screen the number of questions doesn't seem to add up. What is happening?</h2></div>
<div class="p">There may be a situation where you have two components of the same type and see an odd number of questions in the analysis screen. This would occur if the components are in zones with different security assurance levels (SALs). For example, an application server in a zone with a low SAL may have 10 associated questions and an application server in a zone with a high SAL may have 15 questions associated with it, due to the higher requirements. The total number of questions would be 25 for both servers. </div>
