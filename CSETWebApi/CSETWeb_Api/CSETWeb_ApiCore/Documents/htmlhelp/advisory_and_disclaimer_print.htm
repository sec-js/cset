<div class="p h2"><h2>Advisory</h2></div>
<div class="p">The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®) is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust cyber security program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of security weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization's security posture.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. CSET® is not intended as a substitute for in‑depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach including facility walk-downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices. Consideration should also be given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not compromise production or safety.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting of representatives from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The representatives must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has the span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
<div class="p">Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a manner appropriate to their sensitivity.</div>
<div class="p">&#160;</div>
